Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Caleb Fox, and I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences in the world of statistics, data science, and my many hobbies and interests.

I'm currently a doctoral candidate at Baylor University studying statistics. My research is an ongoing exploration of the estimation of self-exciting point processes. However, my true passion for statistics is to serve my creator and to worship Jesus through these analytic skills I have been given. I believe modern data analytics tools provide an exciting new way to show God's love by supporting the efforts of Churches and missions organizations to serve those in need and share the good news of Jesus!

On this blog, I'll be sharing insights, applications, and thoughts on various topics related to statistics, data science, R programming, and other areas that pique my interest. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast or just curious about the world of analytics, I hope you'll find something of value here.

In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, disc golf, playing piano, reading a good book, and cheering on the White Sox. As a true data nerd, analyses of these hobbies may show up on this blog from time to time.

Thank you for visiting my blog! If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to [email me](mailto:caleb_fox2@baylor.edu).

Happy reading!

Caleb Fox
